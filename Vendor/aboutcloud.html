Instead of installing and maintaining software, you simply access it via the Internet, freeing yourself from complex software and hardware management. 
The provider manages access to the application, including security, availability, and performance.
SaaS business applications are usually accessed by users using a thin client via a web browser.</p>

<h3>What is it?</h3>
<p>Platform as a service (PaaS) is a cloud computing model in which a third-party provider delivers hardware and software tools
usually those needed for application development -- to users over the internet. A PaaS provider hosts the hardware and software on its own infrastructure. 
As a result, PaaS frees users from having to install in-house hardware and software to develop or run a new application.  </p>

<h3>Advantages of PaaS</h3>

<p>
1.Simplicity<br/>
2.Less capital expenses

<h3>What is it?</h3>
<p>ommunications as a Service (CaaS) is an outsourced enterprise communications solution that can be leased from a single vendor. 
Such communications can include voice over IP (VoIP or Internet telephony), instant messaging (IM), 
collaboration and videoconference applications using fixed and mobile devices. CaaS has evolved along the same lines as Software as a Service (SaaS).</p>

<h3>Advantages</h3>

<p>
1.CaaS offers flexibility and expandability that small and medium-sized business might not otherwise afford<br>
2.There is no risk of the system becoming obsolete and requiring periodic major upgrades or replacement.<br>
3.The network capacity and feature set can be changed from day to day if necessary so that functionality keeps pace with demand and resources are not wasted.
